the recipes are not being shown in the frontend, even when the request returns results in line 15 for res.data, what's wrong with this?

I want a modern logo, predominantly purple with warm tones for food, with a blue theme. It should include a chef hat, tilted to the left and a globe or something that denotes that it's a worldwide application for sharing recipes.

----

create an icon from that image to be used in the frontend, just with the globe and the hat

I was thinking the following pages for the frontend application:
- A guest home page, that talks about the application, what users can do, etc.
  - This would be the home page for non logged in users
  - From this page they can register or login
  - A video could be here, along with explanation of best features, etc.
- A login page
  - existent users can use their credentials to login to the site
- A registration page
  - non existent users can register and create an account to have access to all recipes and features
- A main page for logged in users
  - this would be the first page that logged user would see
  - here they can have access to the recipes list that all users have shared
  - with a category navigation bar with icons that belong to categories
    - and when clicked, users will be redirected to search result page
      - that automatically filters by the category selected
      - And highlights the selected category
  - They can use features like:
    - search recipes
      - and use facets to filter
      - with sorting capabilities (asc / desc) by
        - name
        - rating
      - with filtering capabilities, by
        - rating stars
        - categories
        - recently added
    - flag favorites from the list
  - The page have sections like:
    - see list of recipes with the following, visible from the list:
        - name
        - rating
          - score
          - how many people have gave ratings
        - image
        - categories
    - See popular
      - the ones having more ratings and with high stars
    - see recently viewed
    - see my favorites
    - see "you might like" section
      - automatically generated by ai history navigation from all users
    - see most liked section
    - See "trending now" section
- All pages, but login and registration, need to have a footer and a header
    - footer will be the same for all users, regardless if they are logged in or not
      - Terms and conditions
      - Privacy
      - About us
      - Copyright
      - Social media
    - header will have dynamic elements depending if the users are logged or not
      - navigation bar
        - common elements for logged in and guest users
          - logo that redirects to home page
          - language selection icon / button
        - for logged in users:
          - logout icon / button
          - search bar
        - for guest users:
          - register icon / button
          - login icon / button

Any relevant information that I could be missing?, should I have different layouts for different pages?, which pages should be private and which ones should be public?

-----

- please give me a proposal for both wireframes and UI structure

-----

- I'd like sketch-style wireframes

----- in cursor

- I want to have a navigation bar in the dashboard, where the list of categories are shown.
- The categories list is gotten from the backend (http://localhost/api/categories).
- I want the categories to be shown as clickable images (from image attribute)
  - and displayed name below the image.
- I want the link for the categories to be redirected to /category/[slug]
  - where slug is taken from the information gotten from the API.
- I want that categories have the ability to show that they are the active ones if the route matches their slug
  - otherwise to show as inactive
- I want the categories to have a hover in different style
- I want the results to be cached so no excessive calls are done to the backend

@RecipeCard I want to add the following information in the Recipes shown:
- How many times it has been flagged as favorite
- The average rating
- How many times it has been rated
That information comes from these fields respectively:
- favorites_count
- ratings_avg
- ratings_count
I want the information to be formated like this: "[favorites_count] [heart_icon] [ratings_avg] [star_icon] ([ratings_count]", examples:
20+ [heart_icon] 3.5 [star_icon] (1.5k+)
I want the icons taken from this library that already exists as a dependency: @phosphor-icons/react. I want that information to be shown on the bottom left portion of the card

-----
I want now to create a page to see the actual recipe, the recipe page has to show all recipe information:
- title
- description
- ingredients
- instructions
- image (from image_url if present)
- video (from video_url if present)
- servings
- cook time (taken from cook_time_hours and cook_time_minutes)
- preparation time (taken from prep_time_hours and prep_time_minutes)
- calories
The information should be shown in the following layout:
- Head section:
  - title
  - Image
  - Favorites and rating information
  - servings
  - Cook time
  - preparation time
  - calories
- Next section
  - All other information
The page should be in this format: /recipe/[recipe-slug]
The page should call the backend at this endpoint: /api/recipes/slug/[slug] to get the recipe

------
03232025
now I want each card for recipes to link to the recipe detail page, using the recipe slug field, they should redirect to the route "/recipe/[slug]" when clicked

------
I want to have a search page now, where users will be able to search for recipes and use different filters and criteria to search. There's a local server that I have up with meilisearch at http://localhost:7700 to which it can connect. I wand the search page to use the react instant search capabilities.

I'm gettting undefined for this enrivonment variable in the browser: MEILISEARCH_API_KEY, however it's defined in my .env.local file, why is this happening? (if I use the other variable NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL stored in my .env.file, it shows correctly)

------

now I want to have the ability as a user to flag a recipe as favorite. There must be a heart icon, in the recipe detail page @page.js not filled if the recipe is not favorite yet by the current user, and filled if the recipe is already flagges as favorite by the current user in the past.
Clicking the favorite heart icon would flip the favorite flag:
- From not favorite to favorite:
  - it calls this api to set as favorite: POST "localhost/api/favorites", with this body:
    - user_id = current user ID
    - recipe_id = current recipe ID
  - it makes the heart now full with red color
- From favorite to not favorite:
  - it calls this api to remove favorite: DELETE "localhost/api/favorites/{id}"
  - it makes the heart now not full and with gray border
The information to know if the current user flagged or not the current recipe as favorite, comes from the request already used, from this field: favorites. If that has a non empty array, it means the user flagged this as favorite

------
04012025

Now I want to have the ability as a user to rate a recipe with stars.
There must be a line of star icons in the recipe detail page. Not filled if the recipe has not been rated yet by the current user, and filled if the recipe has been already rated by the current user in the past.
It must show always 5 stars, and only the ones representing the rating should be filled and the other empty. If there is no rating at all by the current user, all of them should be empty.
Clicking the star icons would set a rating for the recipe according to the star being clicked:
- First star, rating is one
- Second star, rating is two
- and so on.
Clicking the stars should send a rating request to the backend:
- it calls this api to set the rating: POST "localhost/api/ratings", with this body:
  - user_id = current user ID
  - recipe_id = current recipe ID
  - stars
- it makes the stars now full with yellow color to represent the rating
There must be a trash icon on the left of the rating
- it means that the rating can be removed for the current user
- it must be gray, disabled and empty if there's no rating, otherwise, it must be filled and clickable, when clicked:
  - it calls this api to remove favorite: DELETE "localhost/api/ratings/{id}"
  - it makes the star icons now not full and with yellow border
The information to know if the current user rated or not the current recipe, comes from the request already used, from this field: ratings. If that has a non empty array, it means the user rated this as recipe, and the value for the rating is on the stars field inside that array

------

If there's already a value for a rating, instead of sending another POST request when another star is clicked, it should use a PATCH request instead. That way the record in the DB is updated, rather than inserting a new one.

------

I want logged users now to have the ability to add recipes. The backend API to create recipes is "localhost/api/recipes". This is an example of a request for required fields:
{
    "user_id": 1,
    "title": "From postman 3",
    "description": "Test",
    "ingredients": "one, dos, trois, vier",
    "instructions": "cook and it will be ready",
    "image_url": "http://localhost:3000/images/recipes/no-dish-placeholder.jpeg",
    "slug": "from-postman-3",
    "servings": 4,
    "prep_time_hours": 0,
    "prep_time_minutes": 30,
    "cook_time_hours": 1,
    "cook_time_minutes": 0,
    "calories": 500,
    "categories": [1, 2]
}
Considerations for fields:
- user_id:
  - taken from the session
  - required
  - not visible in form, but sent in the request to create the recipe to the backend
- Title:
  - input box
  - required
- Description:
  - text area input
  - required
- ingredients:
  - text area input
  - required
- Instructions:
  - text area input
  - required
- image_url
  - what's the best strategy for this if images should be generated by AI, then saved / posted to be saved in the public/images/recipes folder?
  - this should be a URL sent to the backend
  - required
  - in the mean time, use this default value for it: http://localhost:3000/images/recipes/no-dish-placeholder.jpeg
- slug
  - required
  - auto generated based on title
- servings
  - numeric input
  - from 1 to 8
  - required
- preparation time
  - should be a combination of 2 inputs:
    - one for hour
    - another for time
  - required
- cook time
  - should be a combination of 2 inputs:
    - one for hour
    - another for time
  - required
- Calories
  - numeric input
  - required
- categories
  - a combo box (multi select)
  - optional
  - categories should come from the list of categories gotten from the backend from this endpoint: localhost/api/categories

Other considerations:
- the user should be redirected to a new page (My recipes) where:
  - Only recipes created by the user are shown
  - a success notification message should be shown after creating the recipe on success
- Validation should be present in the form
  - Errors should be shown at input level if any
  - a general error message should be shown too
  - inputs with errors should be highlighted
  - values that are correct should "survive" validation

------

I want to add now the ability to edit a recipe, with the same required considerations for adding a recipe as requested previously

now I want to implement the ability to delete recipes, with the same criteria than editing, meaning, button should be displayed in the recipe detail page, and only for the author of that recipe. There must be a confirmation dialog shown before actually sending the delete request to the backend, which is: "localhost/api/recipes/slug/{{slug}}", use a button that has a trash icon and put it next to the edit recipe button from previous request.

set up the project to be able to test with playwright, don't add any tests yet. I'll add them gradually one by one later

create a test for which the user goes to the home page: http://localhost:3000/ and the user must see a link to login page http://localhost:3000/login and http://localhost:3000/register, the links must have the words: "Login" and "Register" respectively

yes, add this case now: Login page http://localhost:3000/login @page.js should have an email input, a password input, a "remember me" check box, a "Forgot your password" link and a "Login" button with "Login" caption. When credentials are entered, it redirects to the recipes page: @page.js http://localhost:3000/recipes

-------

I want to have now the ability for the user to add comments to the recipe. Consider the following:
- Only logged in users can add comments to the recipe.
- The comments can be added in the recipe detail page only.
- It should be a simple implementation, with a list of comments at the end of the page.
- It should show the user first,
  - then when the comment was created in a friendly way (3 days ago, 3 hours ago)
  - then the comment
  - then below the question,
  - then the name user who posted the question,
  - then how many replies it has with a symbol
    - (a triangle facing down or a caret) that it can be clicked to reveal the replies.
- Comments only can have one level replies, meaning, replies cannot have replies.
- Replies shouldn't low immediately on recipe page, but after clicking the symbol, by sending a request to the backend.
  - Replies are loaded by calling this api from the backend: localhost/api/comments/{id}/replies
- Comments should load when the page is loading.
  - In the meantime they load, a loading text should be displayed
- If the recipe has more than 10 comments, there should be a "Load more" button at the end
  - that allows to load more comments associated to that recipe, by calling this request: "localhost/api/comments/recipe-slug/spaghetti-carbonara".
    - That request has pagination links and structure
- Both request for comments and for replies are paginated, they have this structure:
```
{
  "current_page": number,
  "data": array,
  "first_page_url",
  "from",
  "last_page",
  "last_page_url",
  "links": [
    {
      "url",
      "label"
      "active"
    },
  ],
  "next_page_url",
  "path",
  "per_page",
  "prev_page_url",
  "to",
  "total"
}
```
- There should be a button that says: "Add comment" at the top of the list of the comments
  - When clicked, a modal should appear with a text area that allows the user to submit a comment
    - submissions are using this request: localhost/api/comments with body: recipe_id, content as required
- There should be a button that says; "Reply" at the bottom of each comment
  - when clicked, a modal should appear with a test area that allows the user to submit a Reply
    - submissions are using this request: localhost/api/comments with body: recipe_id, content and parent_id (the id of the comment being replied)

----

I'm getting this error in the build: Module not found: Can't resolve 'date-fns'

----

I don't see any created Modal, and I'm getting this error from the frontend: Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/Modal'

-----

the list of comments in the frontend is duplicate, it shows each comment twice, not one duplicate after the other, but the list twice instead

-----
04102025

I want now for users to have the ability to edit their own comments. Consider the following
- Only comments that have the same user id should be eligible to be edited.
- There must be an "Edit" button shown at the right of the comment eligible to be edited.
- It must have a pencil icon too
- when the button is clicked:
  - a modal should appear, with a text area
    - showing the current comment
    - with an "Edit" button and a "Cancel" button
  - and the ability for the user to change it
- in the list of comments, I want the word "Edited" to appear if the created_date and the updated_date from it are different

-----

I want the users to have the ability to edit their own replies now. Consider:
- Components should be reused
  - Modal, etc.
- Logic should be reused
  - since replies share the same entity than comments
  - "Edited" word should be shown too

-----

I want the recipes to have a badge saying "New", considering:
- if the recipe was created within the last week.
- the "new" badge should be shown in the recipe list
- The "new" badge should also be shown in the searchpage results for the hits
- It must be just a simple badge, but visible enough for user that the recipe is new
- It should be placed to the right of the recipe title
- It shouldn't be shown in the detail page for recipe

-----

it's not showing in the search page for the hits, because the created_at information for the hits is in unix timestamp format

-----
I want now to have the ability to integrate with openai.
- Set up the project to have integration with it
- For now don't implement any code functionality
  - just setup all dependencies and configurations requirements to start developing with it
- if you need further clarification, ask me questions and based on answers we can go from there.

-----

Generated AI image
- I want to have a way for users to submit their recipes with images generated by openai
  - based on information from the form being posted
- I want to have a "Generate recipe image" button in the creation page
  - the button should be only enabled after the following fields are filled from the form:
    - Title
    - Description
    - ingredients
    - Instructions
    - Categories
  - the button should be disabled if any of the values for those inputs is removed
- it should take all the information being inputted so far for the recipe:
  - Title
  - Description
  - ingredients
  - Instructions
  - Categories
- Then it should post that information to openai to request an image
  - for a plate for the recipe being posted
  - with a template like this: "Generate a plate for a recipe with title {title}, description {description}, ingredients {ingredients}, instructions {instructions}, categories {categories}"
    - where values should be replaced from the form being filled
  - The image should be formatted as jpeg
- once the button is clicked:
  - a loading spinner should appear
  - The button should be disabled in the meantime the image is generated
- Once the image is generated
  - The image should be shown
  - The generate button should disappear
  - with an "Accept" button
    - that would make the image to be uploaded to the frontend server in this folder: public/images/recipes
  - a "Reject" button
    - this will not update anything to the server and will remove the image from the form
    - if clicked, the generate button should appear again
- Once the form is submitted
  - The form should sent a field "image_url" having the URL of the image that was just generated
