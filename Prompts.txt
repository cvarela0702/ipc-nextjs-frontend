the recipes are not being shown in the frontend, even when the request returns results in line 15 for res.data, what's wrong with this?

I want a modern logo, predominantly purple with warm tones for food, with a blue theme. It should include a chef hat, tilted to the left and a globe or something that denotes that it's a worldwide application for sharing recipes.

----

create an icon from that image to be used in the frontend, just with the globe and the hat

I was thinking the following pages for the frontend application:
- A guest home page, that talks about the application, what users can do, etc.
  - This would be the home page for non logged in users
  - From this page they can register or login
  - A video could be here, along with explanation of best features, etc.
- A login page
  - existent users can use their credentials to login to the site
- A registration page
  - non existent users can register and create an account to have access to all recipes and features
- A main page for logged in users
  - this would be the first page that logged user would see
  - here they can have access to the recipes list that all users have shared
  - with a category navigation bar with icons that belong to categories
    - and when clicked, users will be redirected to search result page
      - that automatically filters by the category selected
      - And highlights the selected category
  - They can use features like:
    - search recipes
      - and use facets to filter
      - with sorting capabilities (asc / desc) by
        - name
        - rating
      - with filtering capabilities, by
        - rating stars
        - categories
        - recently added
    - flag favorites from the list
  - The page have sections like:
    - see list of recipes with the following, visible from the list:
        - name
        - rating
          - score
          - how many people have gave ratings
        - image
        - categories
    - See popular
      - the ones having more ratings and with high stars
    - see recently viewed
    - see my favorites
    - see "you might like" section
      - automatically generated by ai history navigation from all users
    - see most liked section
    - See "trending now" section
- All pages, but login and registration, need to have a footer and a header
    - footer will be the same for all users, regardless if they are logged in or not
      - Terms and conditions
      - Privacy
      - About us
      - Copyright
      - Social media
    - header will have dynamic elements depending if the users are logged or not
      - navigation bar
        - common elements for logged in and guest users
          - logo that redirects to home page
          - language selection icon / button
        - for logged in users:
          - logout icon / button
          - search bar
        - for guest users:
          - register icon / button
          - login icon / button

Any relevant information that I could be missing?, should I have different layouts for different pages?, which pages should be private and which ones should be public?

- please give me a proposal for both wireframes and UI structure

-----

- I'd like sketch-style wireframes

----- in cursor

- I want to have a navigation bar in the dashboard, where the list of categories are shown.
- The categories list is gotten from the backend (http://localhost/api/categories).
- I want the categories to be shown as clickable images (from image attribute)
  - and displayed name below the image.
- I want the link for the categories to be redirected to /category/[slug]
  - where slug is taken from the information gotten from the API.
- I want that categories have the ability to show that they are the active ones if the route matches their slug
  - otherwise to show as inactive
- I want the categories to have a hover in different style
- I want the results to be cached so no excessive calls are done to the backend

@RecipeCard I want to add the following information in the Recipes shown:
- How many times it has been flagged as favorite
- The average rating
- How many times it has been rated
That information comes from these fields respectively:
- favorites_count
- ratings_avg
- ratings_count
I want the information to be formated like this: "[favorites_count] [heart_icon] [ratings_avg] [star_icon] ([ratings_count]", examples:
20+ [heart_icon] 3.5 [star_icon] (1.5k+)
I want the icons taken from this library that already exists as a dependency: @phosphor-icons/react. I want that information to be shown on the bottom left portion of the card
