I want a modern logo, predominantly purple with warm tones for food, with a blue theme. It should include a chef hat, tilted to the left and a globe or something that denotes that it's a worldwide application for sharing recipes.

create an icon from that image to be used in the frontend, just with the globe and the hat

I was thinking the following pages for the frontend application:
- A guest home page, that talks about the application, what users can do, etc.
  - This would be the home page for non logged in users
  - From this page they can register or login
  - A video could be here, along with explanation of best features, etc.
- A login page
  - existent users can use their credentials to login to the site
- A registration page
  - non existent users can register and create an account to have access to all recipes and features
- A main page for logged in users
  - this would be the first page that logged user would see
  - here they can have access to the recipes list that all users have shared
  - with a category navigation bar with icons that belong to categories
    - and when clicked, users will be redirected to search result page
      - that automatically filters by the category selected
      - And highlights the selected category
  - They can use features like:
    - search recipes
      - and use facets to filter
      - with sorting capabilities (asc / desc) by
        - name
        - rating
      - with filtering capabilities, by
        - rating stars
        - categories
        - recently added
    - flag favorites from the list
  - The page have sections like:
    - see list of recipes with the following, visible from the list:
        - name
        - rating
          - score
          - how many people have gave ratings
        - image
        - categories
    - See popular
      - the ones having more ratings and with high stars
    - see recently viewed
    - see my favorites
    - see "you might like" section
      - automatically generated by ai history navigation from all users
    - see most liked section
    - See "trending now" section
- All pages, but login and registration, need to have a footer and a header
    - footer will be the same for all users, regardless if they are logged in or not
      - Terms and conditions
      - Privacy
      - About us
      - Copyright
      - Social media
    - header will have dynamic elements depending if the users are logged or not
      - navigation bar
        - common elements for logged in and guest users
          - logo that redirects to home page
          - language selection icon / button
        - for logged in users:
          - logout icon / button
          - search bar
        - for guest users:
          - register icon / button
          - login icon / button

Any relevant information that I could be missing?, should I have different layouts for different pages?, which pages should be private and which ones should be public?
