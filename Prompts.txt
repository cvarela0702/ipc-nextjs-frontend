the recipes are not being shown in the frontend, even when the request returns results in line 15 for res.data, what's wrong with this?

I want a modern logo, predominantly purple with warm tones for food, with a blue theme. It should include a chef hat, tilted to the left and a globe or something that denotes that it's a worldwide application for sharing recipes.

----

create an icon from that image to be used in the frontend, just with the globe and the hat

I was thinking the following pages for the frontend application:
- A guest home page, that talks about the application, what users can do, etc.
  - This would be the home page for non logged in users
  - From this page they can register or login
  - A video could be here, along with explanation of best features, etc.
- A login page
  - existent users can use their credentials to login to the site
- A registration page
  - non existent users can register and create an account to have access to all recipes and features
- A main page for logged in users
  - this would be the first page that logged user would see
  - here they can have access to the recipes list that all users have shared
  - with a category navigation bar with icons that belong to categories
    - and when clicked, users will be redirected to search result page
      - that automatically filters by the category selected
      - And highlights the selected category
  - They can use features like:
    - search recipes
      - and use facets to filter
      - with sorting capabilities (asc / desc) by
        - name
        - rating
      - with filtering capabilities, by
        - rating stars
        - categories
        - recently added
    - flag favorites from the list
  - The page have sections like:
    - see list of recipes with the following, visible from the list:
        - name
        - rating
          - score
          - how many people have gave ratings
        - image
        - categories
    - See popular
      - the ones having more ratings and with high stars
    - see recently viewed
    - see my favorites
    - see "you might like" section
      - automatically generated by ai history navigation from all users
    - see most liked section
    - See "trending now" section
- All pages, but login and registration, need to have a footer and a header
    - footer will be the same for all users, regardless if they are logged in or not
      - Terms and conditions
      - Privacy
      - About us
      - Copyright
      - Social media
    - header will have dynamic elements depending if the users are logged or not
      - navigation bar
        - common elements for logged in and guest users
          - logo that redirects to home page
          - language selection icon / button
        - for logged in users:
          - logout icon / button
          - search bar
        - for guest users:
          - register icon / button
          - login icon / button

Any relevant information that I could be missing?, should I have different layouts for different pages?, which pages should be private and which ones should be public?

-----

- please give me a proposal for both wireframes and UI structure

-----

- I'd like sketch-style wireframes

----- in cursor

- I want to have a navigation bar in the dashboard, where the list of categories are shown.
- The categories list is gotten from the backend (http://localhost/api/categories).
- I want the categories to be shown as clickable images (from image attribute)
  - and displayed name below the image.
- I want the link for the categories to be redirected to /category/[slug]
  - where slug is taken from the information gotten from the API.
- I want that categories have the ability to show that they are the active ones if the route matches their slug
  - otherwise to show as inactive
- I want the categories to have a hover in different style
- I want the results to be cached so no excessive calls are done to the backend

@RecipeCard I want to add the following information in the Recipes shown:
- How many times it has been flagged as favorite
- The average rating
- How many times it has been rated
That information comes from these fields respectively:
- favorites_count
- ratings_avg
- ratings_count
I want the information to be formated like this: "[favorites_count] [heart_icon] [ratings_avg] [star_icon] ([ratings_count]", examples:
20+ [heart_icon] 3.5 [star_icon] (1.5k+)
I want the icons taken from this library that already exists as a dependency: @phosphor-icons/react. I want that information to be shown on the bottom left portion of the card

-----
I want now to create a page to see the actual recipe, the recipe page has to show all recipe information:
- title
- description
- ingredients
- instructions
- image (from image_url if present)
- video (from video_url if present)
- servings
- cook time (taken from cook_time_hours and cook_time_minutes)
- preparation time (taken from prep_time_hours and prep_time_minutes)
- calories
The information should be shown in the following layout:
- Head section:
  - title
  - Image
  - Favorites and rating information
  - servings
  - Cook time
  - preparation time
  - calories
- Next section
  - All other information
The page should be in this format: /recipe/[recipe-slug]
The page should call the backend at this endpoint: /api/recipes/slug/[slug] to get the recipe

------

now I want each card for recipes to link to the recipe detail page, using the recipe slug field, they should redirect to the route "/recipe/[slug]" when clicked

------
I want to have a search page now, where users will be able to search for recipes and use different filters and criteria to search. There's a local server that I have up with meilisearch at http://localhost:7700 to which it can connect. I wand the search page to use the react instant search capabilities.

I'm gettting undefined for this enrivonment variable in the browser: MEILISEARCH_API_KEY, however it's defined in my .env.local file, why is this happening? (if I use the other variable NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL stored in my .env.file, it shows correctly)

now I want to have the ability as a user to flag a recipe as favorite. There must be a heart icon, in the recipe detail page @page.js not filled if the recipe is not favorite yet by the current user, and filled if the recipe is already flagges as favorite by the current user in the past.
Clicking the favorite heart icon would flip the favorite flag:
- From not favorite to favorite:
  - it calls this api to set as favorite: POST "localhost/api/favorites", with this body:
    - user_id = current user ID
    - recipe_id = current recipe ID
  - it makes the heart now full with red color
- From favorite to not favorite:
  - it calls this api to remove favorite: DELETE "localhost/api/favorites/{id}"
  - it makes the heart now not full and with gray border
The information to know if the current user flagged or not the current recipe as favorite, comes from the request already used, from this field: favorites. If that has a non empty array, it means the user flagged this as favorite

Now I want to have the ability as a user to rate a recipe with stars.
There must be a line of star icons in the recipe detail page. Not filled if the recipe has not been rated yet by the current user, and filled if the recipe has been already rated by the current user in the past.
It must show always 5 stars, and only the ones representing the rating should be filled and the other empty. If there is no rating at all by the current user, all of them should be empty.
Clicking the star icons would set a rating for the recipe according to the star being clicked:
- First star, rating is one
- Second star, rating is two
- and so on.
Clicking the stars should send a rating request to the backend:
- it calls this api to set the rating: POST "localhost/api/ratings", with this body:
  - user_id = current user ID
  - recipe_id = current recipe ID
  - stars
- it makes the stars now full with yellow color to represent the rating
There must be a trash icon on the left of the rating
- it means that the rating can be removed for the current user
- it must be gray, disabled and empty if there's no rating, otherwise, it must be filled and clickable, when clicked:
  - it calls this api to remove favorite: DELETE "localhost/api/ratings/{id}"
  - it makes the star icons now not full and with yellow border
The information to know if the current user rated or not the current recipe, comes from the request already used, from this field: ratings. If that has a non empty array, it means the user rated this as recipe, and the value for the rating is on the stars field inside that array

------

If there's already a value for a rating, instead of sending another POST request when another star is clicked, it should use a PATCH request instead. That way the record in the DB is updated, rather than inserting a new one.

------

I want logged users now to have the ability to add recipes. The backend API to create recipes is "localhost/api/recipes". This is an example of a request for required fields:
{
    "user_id": 1,
    "title": "From postman 3",
    "description": "Test",
    "ingredients": "one, dos, trois, vier",
    "instructions": "cook and it will be ready",
    "image_url": "http://localhost:3000/images/recipes/no-dish-placeholder.jpeg",
    "slug": "from-postman-3",
    "servings": 4,
    "prep_time_hours": 0,
    "prep_time_minutes": 30,
    "cook_time_hours": 1,
    "cook_time_minutes": 0,
    "calories": 500,
    "categories": [1, 2]
}
Considerations for fields:
- user_id:
  - taken from the session
  - required
  - not visible in form, but sent in the request to create the recipe to the backend
- Title:
  - input box
  - required
- Description:
  - text area input
  - required
- ingredients:
  - text area input
  - required
- Instructions:
  - text area input
  - required
- image_url
  - what's the best strategy for this if images should be generated by AI, then saved / posted to be saved in the public/images/recipes folder?
  - this should be a URL sent to the backend
  - required
  - in the mean time, use this default value for it: http://localhost:3000/images/recipes/no-dish-placeholder.jpeg
- slug
  - required
  - auto generated based on title
- servings
  - numeric input
  - from 1 to 8
  - required
- preparation time
  - should be a combination of 2 inputs:
    - one for hour
    - another for time
  - required
- cook time
  - should be a combination of 2 inputs:
    - one for hour
    - another for time
  - required
- Calories
  - numeric input
  - required
- categories
  - a combo box (multi select)
  - optional
  - categories should come from the list of categories gotten from the backend from this endpoint: localhost/api/categories

Other considerations:
- the user should be redirected to a new page (My recipes) where:
  - Only recipes created by the user are shown
  - a success notification message should be shown after creating the recipe on success
- Validation should be present in the form
  - Errors should be shown at input level if any
  - a general error message should be shown too
  - inputs with errors should be highlighted
  - values that are correct should "survive" validation

I want to add now the ability to edit a recipe, with the same required considerations for adding a recipe as requested previously

now I want to implement the ability to delete recipes, with the same criteria than editing, meaning, button should be displayed in the recipe detail page, and only for the author of that recipe. There must be a confirmation dialog shown before actually sending the delete request to the backend, which is: "localhost/api/recipes/slug/{{slug}}", use a button that has a trash icon and put it next to the edit recipe button from previous request.
